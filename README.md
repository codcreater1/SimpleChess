# SimpleChess

A simple console-based chess game written in C++.  
This project demonstrates basic chess mechanics with a text-based board.

- Allows user to move pieces using standard algebraic notation (e.g., `e2 e4`)
- Supports basic pawn movement rules (white moves up, black moves down)
- Continuous game loop until the player quits by typing `q`

## How to Play

1. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the program in your terminal.
3. Enter moves in the format: `e2 e4`
4. Type `q` to quit the game.
